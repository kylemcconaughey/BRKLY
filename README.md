# [BRKLY: Backend API](https://brkly.herokuapp.com/)
![Barkley Logo](https://brkly.s3.amazonaws.com/post_images/barkley_logo.png "Barkley Logo")
### BRKLY is a REST API built with Django, for use with the [Barkley](http://barkley.netlify.app/) front-end app using React. 

The [BRKLY API](https://brkly.herokuapp.com/) provides the backend & API of our Barkley app. Barkley allows users to create dog and owner profiles, connect with other users via direct message and discussion boards, schedule meetups based on location, and share posts to a newsfeed.

This was the final project for [Momentum Learning](https://www.momentumlearn.com/), created by [Kyle McConaughey](https://github.com/kylemcconaughey) and [Clint Jordan](https://github.com/clintjordan5).

| POST | `/notifications/ping/?p=<username>` | Creates a `Notification` object where `sender` = `self.request.user`, `recipient` = `<username>`, and `trigger` = `"mention"` | Do not put quotes or anything around `<username>` in the url, do not send anything in the body of the POSTing, the API will auto-fill everything |
| GET | `/websockets/` | HTML page with unordered list of notifications | Currently points to an HTML template, needs to change but I'm not sure how - probably involves front-end setting up some websocket stuff to receive notifications? |
